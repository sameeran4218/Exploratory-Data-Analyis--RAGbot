# Exploratory Data Analysis and Ragbot

## Project Description

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sports dataset and visualizing the data through various graphs. Additionally, the dataset has been uploaded to Flowise AI, where a Ragbot has been created using the OpenAI agent and Hugging Face. The Ragbot is capable of answering questions about the dataset in a friendly and interactive manner. A video demonstrating the project's functionalities has also been uploaded to Google Drive.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and executing the data analysis code.
- **Flowise AI**: Platform used for hosting the dataset and creating the Ragbot.
- **OpenAI**: For integrating the AI agent.
- **Hugging Face**: For enhancing the Ragbot's NLP capabilities.
